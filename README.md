## About
I'm a student and developer currently pursuing my studies at Galgotias University, India.

As a developer, I enjoy exploring different approaches to solve problems, and you'll often find me creating and developing non-conventional approaches to solve problems.

## Tools and Expertise

- I have an interest in Linux, with a fair understanding of its core utilities.
- Java is my preferred language, and I also know Swift, Lua (particularly from Neovim), Nix, and Bash.
- I use Neovim as my primary code editor and a bare-metal Linux install of NixOS for development.

## Projects & Contributions


- Although I have limited contributions to open-source projects, I enjoy reading and learning from others' code.

### Recently


- Developed a SaaS using the Swift toolchain during a 4-week internship at Infosys Mysore. I served as the Scrum Master for a team of 10, working within an agile development model.
- Made valuable connections and learned from some incredible people during my internship.
